# Acey Ducey Haskell Version
As a perfect nerd stereotype, I spent part of my teen ages typing frantically long Basic lists on my ZXSpectrum rubber keyboards.
Lately I stumbled upon this blog post (http://rubyredbricks.com/blog/2013/10/07/basic-games-in-ruby/), in which the author notice how bad was the code we '80s kid geeks were used to write, and wonder 'what if' our main language were Ruby.
But... what if our main language were Haskell?
